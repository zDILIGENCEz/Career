### Aim of this blog:

In order not to lose my learning progress due to book licences, I will be recording my progress here in text format what I have done. I want to make my learning progress more transparent and maybe this will help someone else in their endeavours.

:star2: My final goal is to develop and publish a game in Apple Arcade.

### Daily report:

I started with the book [2D Apple Games by tutorials](https://www.kodeco.com/379-2d-apple-games-by-tutorials-updated-for-swift-4-and-ios-11) 1 month ago and stopped on **Chapter 11: Crop, Video, and Shape Nodes**

#### 14 August 2023: 
End chapter 11, start **Chapter 12: Beginning Tile Maps**. Inspired with starting a new game by this chapter. Previous Cat Nap is really borring in the end. But it provides all important beginning information for start developing.
Btw, interesting application of translate custom shapes to swift bezier code (https://www.paintcodeapp.com/).

#### 21 August 2023:
Find time for update this blog. So far I am steel on chapter 12. I have done some subchapters. For now I am playing with creating characters. 

Interesting free service of pictures set for games https://kenney.nl/assets.

#### 22 August 2023:
End chapter 12. This is so interesting when you can understand the parts of game creatinon. From this point I became more realistic about the possibility of achieving my goal.

#### 23 August 2023:
Start **Chapter 13: Intermediate Tile Maps**. Just it.

#### 24 August 2023:
Almost end chapter 13, stopped on chellange.
