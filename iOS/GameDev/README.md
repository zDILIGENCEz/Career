### Aim of this blog:

In order not to lose my learning progress due to book licences, I will be recording my progress here in text format what I have done. I want to make my learning progress more transparent and maybe this will help someone else in their endeavours.

:star2: My final goal is to develop and publish a game in Apple Arcade.

### Daily report:

I started with the book [2D Apple Games by tutorials](https://www.kodeco.com/379-2d-apple-games-by-tutorials-updated-for-swift-4-and-ios-11) 1 month ago and stopped on **Chapter 11: Crop, Video, and Shape Nodes**
